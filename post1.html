      <p>Mastering online advertising trends is the key to success in today’s age. There are popular trends amongst the internet in regards to social media being what reaches our generation the most. More than 40% of the planet’s population actively uses the internet, making it the main market for advertisers. In particular, smartphones are what have highly contributed to the sky rocket of online users. How does the web take advantage of this? One example is the daisy-chain of companies that actually give real people the task of studying people themselves and gather information about them, which they then sell. As crazy as it sounds, the places you shop from send off info about you to other businesses. But of course, this method isn’t as efficient as it would be difficult to properly track billions of shoppers.</p>
<p> The incredible databases created by worldwide online platforms including Facebook, LinkedIn, Amazon and Google have made it easy to understand these online analytics. What makes these companies so successful is the fact that they can efficiently  make use out of all these statistics about how users interact with advertisements. The secret is these programs tracking every move you make as you browse the web. This applies not just to the conscious information you provide through your online profiles, but by what you click and search for online. Systems consider the online population’s demographics, gender, and behavior when calculating what advertisements work best under what situations. This term is also known as metadata.</p>
<p>The marketing strategy that is slowly dominating is progammatic ads. This involves the live manipulation of ads viewers see based off of algorithms, combining the previously mentioned progressions of advertising. This is how most of the ads we see today are made for us. You can probably tell from the kinds of ads you see as you scroll through Facebook or Instagram that these advertisements were not just randomly chosen out of nowhere. Companies are literally grabbing as much data they can about you to advertise what they believe will entice you the most. Scary, isn’t it?
