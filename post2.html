      <h2>THE FUTURE OF ONLINE ADVERTISING</h2>
      <center> <img src="images/post2image.jpg" width=600px></center>
      <p>The Salesforce’s Digital Advertising 2020 Report that was published at the beginning of this year released the future plans and goals of today’s advertising. About nine hundred leaders of the world’s biggest advertisers participated in a survey in regards to their hopes, strategies, and concerns in order to continue improving their web data analytics. These advertisers are primarily located across Europe, Asia-Pacific region, and North America. They are the leads behind what drives the success of the most popular social networking platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. By next year, the plan is for 66% of digital advertising to go toward these mainstream user interfaces.
</p>
<p> Advertisers also intend to upscale the mean quantity of integrated data sources from 5.4 today to 6.2 in 2019, actively hunting for new effective advertising and customer insights. The Salesforce study discovered that customer relationship management (CRM), online, and demographic statistics are the most frequent sources of information in regards to data and larger marketing technology stacks. Demographic data is the most known kind of information, pertaining to individuals’ interests, location, and personal data. On the other hand, CRM-based data is the statistics gathered from emails or phone numbers. Online data is first-party anonymous, second-party, or third-party info collecting. As the world of marketing concentrates on increasing Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) and Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLS), automation system-driven analytics are growing to be more essential for quality advertising.
